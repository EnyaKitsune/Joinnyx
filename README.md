# 42nd Support Division 'NYX'
 
NYX is a Colonial loyalist support regiment for the game Foxhole; We do most stuff in the game, from building and logistics, to artillery and tanking, though we have no problem getting our hands dirty if the situation calls for it.

We're a mixture of older and newer players, and we pride ourselves in being an inclusive space for women and LGBT players, in addition to showing newer players the ropes.
