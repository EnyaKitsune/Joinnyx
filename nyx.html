    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Formed during War 87, NYX is a well-rounded, Colonial loyalist, support regiment that does most stuff in the game, from building and logistics, to artillery and tanking, though we have no problem getting our hands dirty if the situation calls for it.
      
      We're a mixture of older and newer players, and we pride ourselves in being an inclusive space for women and LGBT players (who form the majority of our members), in addition to showing newer players the ropes.

    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Constructive criticism is appreciated! we are building a regiment where everyone is equal and deserves to have their input considered</li>
      <li>Keep your perspectives open, we have a lot of knowledgeable people</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to limit any non member's access if we receive information of problematic behaviour from reliable sources</li>
      <li>Do not share or otherwise divulge in-regiment information without consent</li>
      <li>If you are making anyone uncomfortable, you get one (1) warning. Continuing further will result in a mute/timeout.</li>
